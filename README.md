VBA Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
In this project, we analyzed two separate sheets with 3,013 rows of data based on stocks in the years 2017 and 2018. There were a total of 12 different stock tickers that had to be counted and find their total daily volume as well as their return percentage. With the original code we had, we were able to make more macros for certain functions such as clearing the worksheet, formatting, and making a button to automatically compute the data but as we got towards the end of the project we had to refactor the code to make it shorter and more efficient. It even ran the codes at a faster rate. 


## Results
The results of this project showed that it took Excel the same amount of time to run the code for the years 2017 and 2018. The execution time of the original script was notably longer than the new refactored script.

As for the returns, in the year 2017, all stocks has positive returns except for “TERP”. And in the year 2018, all stocks had negative returns with the exceptions of “ENPH” and “RUN”.

## Summary

**1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**

The advantage of refactoring code is that it can make the execution faster as well as be able to take more inputs such as tickers and still be able to work swiftly it can also make it simpler to read since there is less coding. A disadvantage could be having more errors due to the fact that since you are no longer breaking it down part by part, you may easily forget to write a step or skip a part accidentally. It may take more time to refactor as well rather than just leaving the code long as it is.

**2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

These pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script because we experienced both pros and cons throughout the process. For example, for the advantages, it did make the execution time faster which is ultimately better for the computer since it doesn’t have to work as hard to read all the extra codes. Also after refactoring it was way easier to read compared to having to scroll through. The pages to find each macro and specific details. On the other hand, we also did experience some disadvantages such as it did take some extra time to refactor the codes and also there was a part in which I had accidentally added an extra code and when trying to run the code an error was showing, and it led to a minor confusion. Overall, I like the concept of refactoring and hope to get better at it as we go. Thank you.
